# Custom_FAISS_VectorDB

In this project, I have built a custom vector database using LangChain and FAISS. Research papers in PDF format can be uploaded and converted into embeddings using an open-source Hugging Face model. The system utilizes the Groq API to call a large language model (llama-3.1-8b-instant) for question answering. Users can ask questions related to the content of the research papers, and the system returns answers based on similarity search within the embedded documents.
